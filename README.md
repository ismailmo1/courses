# Courses

This repo is a collection of all the resources i've used over the years to learn new things and educate myself on different technologies.

I have a broad range of interests (and maybe a short attention span) so I've split this up into the following domains:

- [Data Science](/datasci)
- [Web Technologies](/web)
- [Programming Languages](/languages)
- [Devops stuff](/devops)
