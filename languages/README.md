# Language Resources

I first got started with VBA when I realised that I could automate 75% of my job which was mostly typing in dimensions from engineering drawings into excel calculators that engineers before me had made.

I was given a monster of an excel sheet on my first day at work and I remember googling every excel function that I came across, panicking at the thought of not passing my probation because I had no clue how this workbook worked. The microsoft docs are a great resource but Excel is used by [half a billion people](https://www.google.com/search?q=excel+usage+statistics) worldwide so you'll never be short on answers when googling something.

- [Excel Easy](https://www.excel-easy.com/vba.html) -
  I went through all 16 sections of the VBA section, but the other parts are great too.
- [Paul Kelly](https://excelmacromastery.com/vba-articles/) - If you develop long enough in VBA (sorry) this man will save your will to live multiple times a day

<summary>Python</summary>

### [Jose Portilla's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

Jose is a great teacher and taught me all the fundamentals of python - but it's taught all in jupyter notebooks which I wouldn't recommend to beginners. Most of my practice of programming came from replacing my excel usage at work with python but I limited myself to data analytics stuff and it took me a while before I started exploring other parts of python.

### [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms)

Corey has a video on nearly every python topic, really helped understand OOP concepts in python and helped fill the gaps in my python knowledge due to overusing notebooks.

### [Arjan Codes](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArjanCodes)

Arjan's channel focuses on good software engineering practices, how to implement design patterns and avoid code smells.

### [James Murphy's MCoding](https://www.youtube.com/c/mCodingWithJamesMurphy)

Youtube is full of beginner tutorials and it's difficult to find more advanced topics in python: MCoding is one of the hidden gems where I've learnt a lot from.

### [Typescript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

I've mainly learnt by building stuff however this means I'm always using the docs as a reference and making use of the [typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) to try things out.
