# Data Science Resources

Data science is what got me really excited about learning python, but practically data analytics is what I ended up using the most at work since having clean and repeatable datasets alone provided so much value at the time. Being able to automatically extract data from business systems, apply logic to aggregate and combine with other data sources felt like magic and it kept me busy enough to stay away from any real data sciency stuff.

I'm still fascinated by data science - it seems as though a lot of technological breakthroughs in recent times have been in the area so it's always nice to feel like I understand atleast some of it.

## Courses

<details>
<summary><b>Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science</b></summary>

[Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

After learning the basics of python, I jumped into this data science course since it felt like the "natural progression" - going back I would've definitely built something using the skills I already had.

Nevertheless I learnt some really useful skills that helped me massively at work - I had already automated everything in VBA but python was much nicer to work with and I could work a lot faster with the libraries I learnt in this course.

What I learnt:

- Pandas, numpy
- Data viz: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning basics

<summary><b>Andrew Ng's ML Course on Coursera</b></summary>

[Coursera: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This is one of the most enjoyable courses I've done so far, Andrew's teaching style is famously awesome. I used Octave to complete the exercises and although I didn't pay for the certificate (yet), all the exercises I submitted can be [found here](https://github.com/ismailmo1/ml_ng)

The best part of the course was how the maths wasn't glossed over too much and also how "raw" the code felt, I was actually implementing the vectorised functions for gradient descent, adding regularisation terms in manually and seeing the impact on the model. I hated that the course was in Octave at the start but I really appreciated it later on.

Some of the Stuff I learnt:

- Linear Algebra for ML
- Regularisation
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Practical ML Advice: tradeoffs, system design
- Neural Networks

<summary><b>scikit-learn's MOOC</b></summary>

[Inria Foundation: Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/)

I felt like I understood the basic mechanics behind some of the models but I didn't feel comfortable with the tools and ecosystem of scikit-learn. Again I didn't take my own advice and jump into a project - but this course had just come out from the scikit-learn core developers and it was a great overview of the library. Coming back to python from octave made me appreciate how much functionality is packed into scikit-learn, no wonder its so popular with the data science community!

You can find all my notebooks from the [course here](https://github.com/ismailmo1/sklearn-mooc)

Some of the Stuff I learnt:

- Building pipelines in scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross validation methodology
- Model evaluation

## Whats next?

An actual data science project that I complete end to end! I recently completed a more analytics [focussed project](https://wrapped.ismailmo.com) to scrape myfitnesspal data so developing a model to predict strength or weight loss from my food consumption could be the next step.
